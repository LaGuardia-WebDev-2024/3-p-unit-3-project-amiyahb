  <p><strong>For the marinade (do the night before if possible)</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine the spring onions, ginger, garlic, onion, scotch bonnet chillies, dried thyme, lime juice, soy sauce, vegetable oil, brown sugar and ground allspice in a food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée.</p>
 <p>- don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.</p>

Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly salty. Add more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well-balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a few light cuts in the chicken breasts and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pre-heat the oven to 180/200C.</p>

<p>In a large frying pan, add a little oil and place the marinated chicken skin down. Fry until starting to crisp. Flip to seal the other side.</p>

<p>Now, place into the oven (skin side up) either in the ovenproof pan or use another tray. Cook for approx. 15 mins or until the chicken has an internal temp. of 74C.</p>
<p><strong>Cook the rice and peas</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> While the chicken is cooking, make the rice and peas.</p>

<p>Tip the rinsed rice into a large saucepan. Add the coconut milk, spring onions, thyme, garlic and allspice. Season with salt and pepper and add 300 ml water.</p>

<p>Bring to a boil, add the beans, then turn off the heat and cover the pan and let steam for approx. 15 mins until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Serve on a large platter with the rice and peas first and slices of chicken over top.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a deep skillet or medium pot, heat 2-3 inches of vegetable oil.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cut off the tips of the plantain at each end and then make three cuts down the side, just breaking through the peel.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Peel the plantain with your fingers or a knife.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Cut plantains into 1-inch chunks and add to oil. Fry for 5-6 minutes until they turn golden brown, flipping half-way through. Take them out and let them rest on a paper towel.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Using the tostonera, crush the fried plantains into a thin disk.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Fry them again for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown and crisp, flipping half-way through.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Serve on a plate, add salt or Adobo to taste, and enjoy!</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Melt butter with garlic very slowly to avoid burning the garlic. Season with parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add cooked pasta to the skillet and toss until well coated with butter. Increase the heat to medium and cook until pasta is heated through and has absorbed some of the butter. Adjust seasonings if necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
